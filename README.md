# Sonar_Signal_Classification

This project holds immense significance as it showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques for binary classification. It accomplishes this by utilizing the "Sonar" dataset. The code employs a Random Forest model, effectively illustrating the process of training, evaluating, and visualizing the model's performance. This project imparts a fundamental skill in data science and predictive modeling - the ability to work with real-world datasets, preprocess the data, and implement machine learning algorithms. The result of this project offers valuable understanding regarding the efficacy of Random Forests in differentiating between man-made and natural rocks through sonar signals. This knowledge holds significant practical value for fields like signal processing and underwater acoustics. Furthermore, the utilization of R programming language along with widely-used packages such as caret and mlbench showcases the adaptability and ease-of-use of these tools for tasks involving data analysis, signal processing and machine learning.
